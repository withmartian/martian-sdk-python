    """A Judge resource representing a Martian judge configuration.

    This class serves as the primary interface for judge operations in the SDK.
    Judge instances are returned by JudgeClient methods (`create_judge`, `get`, `list`)
    and are used as parameters for operations like evaluating completions or training routers.

    Judges should not be created from this class. Instead, use the `JudgeClient` to create and manage judges.

    The Judge is immutable. You can not update it directly from instances of this class.
    Instead, use the `JudgeClient` to update the judge.
    Any updates create a new version of the judge with an incremented version number.
    Previous versions remain accessible through the `JudgeClient.get()` method.

    Attributes:
        id (str): The judge's identifier.
        version (int): The judge version number. Increments with each update.
        description (str): A human-readable description of the judge's purpose.
        createTime (str): When the judge was created (RFC 3339 format).
        name (str): The judge's full resource name (format: "organizations/{org}/judges/{judge_id}").
        judgeSpec (Dict[str, Any]): The judge's configuration, including rubric and evaluation settings.
