P=NP is a fundamental question in computer science regarding the relationship between problems that can be solved quickly (in polynomial time) and those whose solutions can be verified quickly. Differential equations are typically used in fields such as physics and engineering and do not have a direct, established connection to the methods used in complexity theory or the study of P=NP problems. While the question does bring up the idea of using a mathematical approach to tackling the issue, the specific method of differential equations is unlikely to contribute significantly to advancements in solving P=NP. Therefore, the importance of the question to advancing the target is limited. Overall, I would assign a score of 2.0, indicating that the important question has some relevance but is not particularly effective in advancing the understanding of the P=NP problem.', cost=0.00014985)\n"
